# Hey yo!

Hey! My name is [Denis](/about). This website is my personal space to leave up any information I’m seeing ready to be shared with you, my readers thru different mediums:

- **Guides**. Instead of keeping an outdated information, I prefer to get it updated in the same page, so the same location could tell you the up do date information.
- **Blog** is made to write some short, concise notes about some stuff worth not just sharing, but putting an emphasis on.
- **Comparisons** is a place for score cards for some choices I’ve made. It might not be as useful as other kinds of notes tho.
