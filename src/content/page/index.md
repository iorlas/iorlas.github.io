Hey! My name is [Denis](/about). This website is my personal space to leave up any information I'm seeing ready to be shared with you, *my readers* thru different **mediums**:

- [Knowledge Bases](/kb). Instead of keeping an outdated information, I prefer to get it updated in the same page, so the same location could tell you the up do date information.
- [Blog](/blog) *WIP* is made to write some **short**, **concise** notes about some stuff worth not just sharing, but putting an **emphasis** on.
- [Comparisons](/comparisons) *WIP* is a place for score cards for some choices I've made. It might not be as useful as other kinds of notes tho.

### Knowledge Bases

There are quite a few different kinds of knowledge bases:
- [IT & CS](/kb/it). 
- [Leadership](/kb/leadership) *WIP*.
- [Health](/kb/health) *WIP*. Body & Soul.
- [Travel](/kb/travel) *WIP*.
- [Domains](/kb/domains) *WIP*. Healthcare, Finance, Retail, Travel, etc.
