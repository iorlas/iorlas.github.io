> Delegate or Die

Start small. There is a ton of techniques. Being a manager means you should be able to delegate anything and everything if necessary. JIRA Task, a call with with a stakeholder, a dinner with a new partner, a vet appointment for your cat.

## Start with the SMART

*   **Specific**: The task should be clear. Answers the questions: What, Why, How.
    
*   **Measurable**: The task should be quantifiable. You need to be able to track it's progress.
    
*   **Achievable**: Which constraints you have or you want/**need** to add? Make it possible to achieve by the person. Care about motivation.
    
*   **Relevant**: Why am should a person do it? What you, company, the person will get from it (great example: it will help the project to be unlocked)?
    
*   **Time-bound**: Has a specific time-frame
    

## Examples

*   _Identify and fix the login authentication issue reported in the latest release. Document the fix in our internal wiki and submit a pull request by_ **_EOD tomorrow_**
    
*   _Migrate customer data from the legacy MySQL database to the new PostgreSQL cluster, ensuring 100% data integrity. Perform validation checks using predefined test scripts and complete the migration by the_ **_end of the sprint (next Tuesday)_**
    
*   _Create a 6-month product roadmap in JIRA, breaking down major milestones into epics and defining high-level deliverables for each sprint. Ensure alignment with business priorities and share the first draft with stakeholders by the_ **_end of the month_**
    

## KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid. Start with it, apply it everywhere until you will get the sense of comfort delegating tasks as you please.

Most important: Expect the same strategy to be applied on you. And when it is not applied on your correctly - help the others by asking the right questions.

A **delegation expert** not only **assigns** tasks effectively but also **facilitates their delegation** from higher management.
