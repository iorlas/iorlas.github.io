title: "Engineer to IT Manager: The Essential Drill"
excerpt: "A kick off for a new manager in IT "

**Target Audience**: Existing or yet-to-be Team Leader, Engineering Manager, Project Manager, SCRUM Master)

This article is a collection of thoughts and methodologies which are easy to grasp. For some, it will help to grow and step up to the management positions much sooner. For the others, it will allow to avoid a lot of frustration being a manager.

# Introduction

We are, Homo sapiens , [didn't went that far from monkeys](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6665774/).

In many primates societies, being an alpha male means that you are the leader. However, the role of an alpha male is not solely based on physical strength; it often involves social intelligence, alliances, and the ability to maintain group cohesion. It all lies on the shoulders of alpha - the leader.

# The New Expectations

When you become a leader, it might feel that a lot of things will change. Yet the key expectation will still be the same - you are still responsible for your work: feature, project, code, something else.

The key element which will change is: now you can scale yourself, and people will expect you to scale yourself in a way it will enable larger delivery chunks. Now, you are higher on the **career ladder**.

### Higher from the ladder

*   Larger scope: You are still responsible for delivery. But now - for the larger chunk of work
    
    *   Hence: You need more time to digest the requirements
        
    *   Hence: You need more time to deliver
        
    *   Hence: You need more time to test the code
        
    *   **How?** **Delegate or die**
        
*   Resources: Now you manage people, not just your time and your code
    
    *   Hence: Resources budgets, allocation, availability, needs, and problems
        
*   **No one will care** how you manage your resources
    
    *   Obviously, as long as you manage your resources without many obvious issues
        

### Lower from the ladder:

People under you will depend on you a lot! They will rely on you. They will blame you for every issue higher from the ladder, or, quite often, even lower from the ladder. Many people lower are there to "do one thing, but do it correctly, and call it a day". People are different. Hate it or like it.

*   Conflict management: You should handle it all
    
*   Problems management: If it is mine - it is your problem as well
    
*   Quality: All the code is trash, and it is you who didn't do enough to make things right
    
*   People: Bad people selected, it is you to blame
    

It all might seem _edgy_. But ultimately people will blame you if you if things will go worse.
