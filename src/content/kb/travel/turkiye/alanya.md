## Food

See the general Turki

## Transportation

### Local: Public transportation
Locally there are some busses, mostly operating during summer time. Operating across the sea shore line only, sometimes could be quite late.

### Local: Taxi

*Working time*: 06:00 - 11:00

Uber? Nope. Seek the yellow device with a red button, press on it - if red indicator blinks (although it might be quite dim), then it is cool, wait for like 5 mins - it'll get there. Dispatch-service will get this signal and will call a taxi for you from their park.

### Transfer to/from airport

[transfer24](https://www.724transfer.com/Home)

Driving large minivans - something like 10 seats. Assisting with luggage.

Shared-booking. Could be slightly late, but they are always planning shuttles for specific flights, not randomly. So it is highly unlikely to get late to a flight. Booked quite often, never overbooked.
