title: "Alanya/Mahmutlar"
---

Antalya, Alanya - typical destinations for many europeans during summer time. Prior to 2023 there were a lot of people from Russia and Ukraine. Many Turks speak russian, english, turkish. Since 2023 - things have changed drastically. Now there are a lot of europeans from richer countries - a lot of people from Germany, some people from UK, Spain, Italy.

Anyway, it is a great destination, quite affordable. Nice beaches, infrastructure, cheap food (used to be sooo cheap, but still is cheap enough).

## Language

- Hello - Merhaba (mehr-hah-bah)
- Yes - Evet (eh-vet)
- No - Hayir (hah-yuhr)
- Thank you - TeÃ…Å¸ekkÃƒÂ¼r ederim (teh-shehk-kur eh-deh-reem)


## Food

Traditional. See Istanbul - pretty much the same.

The only two places which are totally different and deserve additional attention:
- Chaihana #1. Asian food. Hand-made noodles, meat, large portions, cheap/moderate cost.
- Dodo pizza. Western food. Many different combos. Cheap/moderate cost

## Transportation

#### Local: Public transportation
Locally there are some busses, mostly operating during summer time. Operating across the sea shore line only, sometimes could be quite late.

#### Local: Taxi
- **Apps**: **Uber**? No. Maybe it is supported already.
- **How to find?** Seek yellow devices with a red button on trees, press on it - if red indicator blinks (although it might be quite dim), then it is cool, wait for like 5 mins - it'll get there. Dispatch-service will get this signal and will call a taxi for you from their park.
- **Working time**: 06:00 - 23:00
- **Pay**: ðŸ’µ Almost always cash.

:::warning

**Can I be tricked?** Yes. When sitting - check the taxometer. It should be fully seen. Don't be afraid to ask about it. During the drive - check how fast it ticks - it should be consistent. Otherwise call it out, tell to stop, pay it, call another taxi.

**Taxometer shows too much already?** Well, don't be a fool the next time. For now - pay what feels like a fair price, tell that you will call a police otherwise (155 or 157).

#### Transfer to/from airport

[Transfer24](https://www.724transfer.com/Home) - Driving large minivans - something like 10 seats. Assisting with luggage. Shared-booking. Could be slightly late, but they are always planning shuttles for specific flights, not randomly. So it is highly unlikely to get late to a flight. Booked quite often, never overbooked.
