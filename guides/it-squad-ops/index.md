# SquadOps — What & Why

> **SquadOps** is a delivery-first model for small, autonomous teams that ship fast and own outcomes. It works for large companies too — just split the org into squads.

Most teams don’t fail because of bad code. They fail because of:
- Endless handoffs and silos
- No clear ownership
- Perfection paralysis and blame games

You’ve seen it:
- Devs waiting on specs
- BAs chasing signoffs
- Designers polishing dreams that never launch
- PMs juggling 80 tickets and zero outcomes
- SAs obsessed with being “right” instead of shipping

**SquadOps kills all of that.**

It shows how a team becomes a *squad*: a delivery-owned, cross-functional unit that ships end-to-end — no delays, no excuses.

## Who This Is For

- Tech Leads tired of playing project babysitter
- BAs and Designers who want to drive delivery, not documentation
- PMs who care about outcomes, not optics

## Who This Is Not For

- Teams addicted to consensus over clarity
- Those who treat process as the product
- Anyone more committed to rituals than results

## What This Guide Delivers

- Battle-tested patterns from real delivery teams
- Structured around actual roles and outcomes
- Zero fluff. No “Spotify Model” cosplay.

You’ll walk away with:
- Squad structures that scale trust and speed
- Branching & CI strategies that unblock UI & API work
- Rituals and tooling that accelerate delivery — not get in the way
