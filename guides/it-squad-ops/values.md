# Values

## Team Values

These shape how we operate **together**:

- **Progress over Perfection**  
  Perfectionism inspires — but unchecked, it paralyzes. We deliver iteratively, test early, and refine fast.

- **Awareness Drives Action**  
  Directionless iteration is chaos. We seek deep understanding of systems, people, and context before acting. No cargo cults.

- **[Think Globally, Act Locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_globally,_act_locally)**  
  We make decisions grounded in today’s constraints — but design systems that can evolve and scale.

- **Make Educated, Risk-Aware Decisions**  
  Use KDDs, ADRs, and risk registries. Always choose the path you can justify in writing.

- **Make It Work → Make It Right → Make It Fast**  
  In that order. Every time.

- **Speed ⏤ Cost ⏤ Quality: Pick Two, Prioritize One**  
  Be explicit. Align the team and stakeholders. Document the trade-off.

- **Write Things Down**  
  Shared memory beats shared assumptions. If it’s not written, it doesn’t exist. Documentation should be a **safe, inclusive space** — everyone contributes.

- **Developer Experience is Sacred**  
  Confusion is tech debt. Friction is a bug. Every contributor matters — especially future ones.

- **Titles Don’t Ship Features**  
  Influence > authority. Clarity > volume. Roles don’t matter — delivery does.

- **Impact or Eliminate**  
  If it doesn’t improve the product, team, or customer outcomes — cut it.

- **Leave Everything Better**  
  From code to communication — clean up as you go.

- **Feedback is Fuel**  
  Internal. External. Frequent. Honest. Fast feedback loops are survival tools.


## Personal Values

These define how **you** show up — as a leader, owner, or contributor:

- **Awareness: Know Yourself**  
  Awareness of your strengths, limits, and biases is your most powerful tool.

- **Design for Impermanence**  
  No system lasts forever. Build with clarity, changeability, and graceful exits.

- **Listen First, Speak Clearly**  
  You are not the smartest person in the room unless you’ve understood everyone else first.

- **Build Stronger Teams**  
  Smart leaders don’t hoard control — they grow capability and trust around them.

- **Trust is Leverage**  
  Micromanagement destroys value. Earn it. Grant it. Defend it. No trust = 80% waste.

- **Own the Mission**  
  You own delivery. You own the team. Act accordingly.
